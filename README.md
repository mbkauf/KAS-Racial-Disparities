Abstract: 

Background and objectives: In December 2014, the Kidney Allocation System (KAS) was implemented to improve
equity in access to transplantation, but preliminary studies in children show mixed results. Thus, we aimed to
assess how the 2014 KAS policy change affected racial and ethnic disparities in pediatric kidney transplantation
access and related outcomes.

Design, setting, participants, & measurements: We performed a retrospective cohort study of children ,18 years
of age active on the kidney transplant list from 2008 to 2019 using the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients.
Log-logistic accelerated failure time models were used to determine the time from first activation on the
transplant list and the time on dialysis to deceased donor transplant, each with KAS era or race and ethnicity as
the exposure of interest. We used logistic regression to assess odds of delayed graft function. Log-rank tests
assessed time to graft loss within racial and ethnic groups across KAS eras.

Results: All children experienced longer wait times from activation to transplantation post-KAS. In univariable
analysis, Black and Hispanic children and other children of color experienced longer times from activation to
transplant compared with White children in both eras; this finding was largely attenuated after multivariable
analysis (time ratio, 1.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.01 to 1.32; time ratio, 1.13; 95% confidence interval, 1.00 to
1.28; and time ratio, 1.17; 95% confidence interval, 0.96 to 1.41 post-KAS, respectively). Multivariable analysis also
showed that racial and ethnic disparities in time from dialysis initiation to transplantation in the pre-KAS era
were mitigated in the post-KAS era. There were no disparities in odds of delayed graft function. Black and
Hispanic children experienced longer times with a functioning graft in the post-KAS era.

Conclusions: No racial and ethnic disparities from activation to deceased donor transplantation were seen before
or after implementation of the KAS in multivariable analysis, whereas time on dialysis to transplantation and
odds of short-term graft loss improved in equity after the implementation of the KAS, without compromising
disparities in delayed graft function.
